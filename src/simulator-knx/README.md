The **KNX Smart Home Simulator** is a development tool that can be used when designing smart infrastructures, such as smart buildings.


This simulator software represents a [KNX system](https://www.knx.org/knx-en/for-professionals/index.php), without real physical devices but virtual ones instead, and models its evolution through time in response to user interactions and to a simulated physical world's influences. With this simulator, one user can configure a KNX system with visual feedback, interact with it and even test applications developed with [**SVSHI**](https://github.com/dslab-epfl/svshi) (**S**ecure and **V**erified **S**mart **H**ome **I**nfrastructure) before implementing them in a real physical KNX system. 

It provides a [CLI](#cli), a [GUI](#gui) to easily interact  with the platform and a script [Script API](#script-api) to run automated tests.

&nbsp;
## Installation

In order to work, the simulator needs Python 3.9 or newer ([download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)). 

You can then download the simulator by either downloading the repository or cloning it. You can also download [SVSHI](https://github.com/dslab-epfl/svshi), as it already includes the simulator.

Being at the root of the simulator (**simulator-knx/**), you can install all the necessary requirements with the following command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```
&nbsp;
## Configuration
The system configuration can be done either by:
- Parsing a JSON file provided by the user **<-- RECOMMENDED**:\
You can configure the configuration file by copying the template from *simulator-knx/config/empty_config.json* and modifying the fields according to your needs. Other more complete templates are accessible in config/ folder.\
  - To use this configuration mode, the following options should be set in argument:\
    `-C=file`             : indicate that a config file will be used (although it is the default setting)\
    `-F=fileconfig_name`  : specify name of the config file to use (without .json) 
- Calling configuration functions and methods in the source code by directly modifying `configure_system()` in *simulator-knx/tools/config_tools*,
  - To use this mode, the following options should be set in argument:\
  `-C=dev` : indicate that the configuration will be done in developper mode, with python functions and methods
- Dynamically interacting with the system through the Graphical User Interface described in [GUI](#gui),
  - To use this mode, the following options should be set in argument:\
  `-i=cli` or gui
  `-c=cli` : indicates that CLI commands can be used, opposed to script mode 
- Combining these approaches

&nbsp;
## Running

You can start the simulator by being at the root of the simulator (**simulator-knx/**) and running `python3 run.py` with the options according to your needs.

You can run `python3 run.py -h` to display the following help:

```

### With SVSHI
If you want to run the simulator with SVSHI, here are the steps:

1. Run the command `python3 run.py -s` (you can add other options if you want to couple SVSHI mode with the GUI, CLI, script API...)
The simulator will start waiting for a connection with SVSHI at the address that it prints on the terminal.
1. Configure a SVSHI app and start SVSHI (either through CLI or GUI, you can refer to more detailed explanations [here](../../README.md) for running SVSHI), when running SVSHI you have to make sure that:
    - The address given to SVSHI for the interface corresponds to the one displayed by our simulator when started.
    - You assigned group addresses to the devices according to the ones SVSHI generated with your application. If not, you can assign group addresses dynamically when using the GUI, or restart the simulator in CLI mode with the correct group addresses configuration.
2. Wait for the connection between the simulator and SVSHI to be completed, and then enjoy!

An example app can be found in foler simulator-knx/svshi_apps. It has a basic functioning: the button turn on the heater, and the light is turned on when the temperature reach 21Â°C. The prototypical file and main app are in the folder. The assignements can be downloaded from [**SVSHI**](https://github.com/dslab-epfl/svshi) directly.

&nbsp;
## CLI
The CLI command are usable during simulation, through shell if interface_mode=CLI, or through the GUI command box if interface_mode=GUI. \
They are not callable in script_mode.\
To make use of CLI commands, the following options can be set in argument:\
-i=cli or gui : in both interface_mode, CLI commands are usable\
-c=cli : CLI commands are not usable in script mode\

## Details for developers

This section is destined to future developers willing to improve or modify the code. It aim is to demystify som subtilities in teh code, the configuration and the global functioning.

### Physical world modeling
One important aspcet of this simulator is the modeling of physical states evolution in time (Brightness, Temperature, Humidity, CO2). For instance, If users turn ON a heater, the temperature should rise, but there is no heating sources, and the outdoor temperature is lower than indoor's, the temperature should decrease.

We based the logic on online references, physical knowledge and intuition, but it can in no case be considered as a 100% truthful representation of the world states. This project only waits for one thing, thta a physicist improve the modeling of physical states :) In the mean time, we provide a arbitrarly acceptable modeling of these states, allowing users to test application involving temperature value for instance.

### Configuration JSON file
The configuration using a json prototype is the most easy way to configure the system. Nevertheless, there are many fields. Let's detail some of them:
- **simulation_speed_factor** and **system_dt**: system_dt corresponds to th etime interval between two consecutive updates, the speed factor allows to compute the concrete simulated time during this interval.
- inside and outside values can be set be the user to configure the intial system state
- **datetime**: indicate when the simulation is launched, possible values are: 
  - 'today', 'yesterday', 'one_week_ago', 'one_month_ago'
  - datetime can also be indicated using format 'YYYY/MM/DD/HH/MM'
  - this config will be integrated to the simulator using a datetime.datetime object
- **weather**: indicates the outdoor weather during the simulation, supposed to be constant (except in script mode), possible values are:
  - 'clear', 'overcast', 'dark'
  - each weather, associated to the datetime, allows to define the outdoor brightness, which can be used to compute indoor resulting brightness on sensors if teh room has windows imlemented.
- **insulation**: represents the room's insulation quality, it will have an effect on evolution of temperature, humidity and co2. Possible values are:
  -  'perfect', 'good', 'average', 'bad'
  - The impact of each insulation type is arbitrarly define through a ratio in world/world_tools.py module.
- **windows' location offset**: define the offset of window's location from start of the wall.
  - windows are defined on walls ('north', 'south', 'east', 'west')
  - the origin of the offset is the south-west room's corner
  - the location offset represnts the distance between this origin and window's location.
  - Take precaution when defining windows, as they should fit in the room or they will be discarded.
- **devices' names**: For usability and understandability of teh code and the system, it is reauired to inser the lower-case class name of a device in its name, associated with a number.

### GUI implementation details
A little detail to note is the difference between the pyglet 'height' and the simulator 'height'.\
The simulation, although it is represented in 2D, implements a room in 3D. The simulator 'height' is thus logically the 3rd axis z getting out of the plan (in GUI mode).\
For pyglet, 'height' is the 2nd axis y (vertical) on the screen plan. Be aware that we call 'length' the pyglet 'height' in the wole code.\
For instance, a Room is defined by its width, length and height.
